# compressible-reservoir

compressible-reservoir is a Python simulator for rock compressibility effect to reservoir simulation and 4D seismic. 

Rock compressibility (Cr) in rocks changes linearly and non-linearly with reservoir pressure (Chertov & Suarez-Rivera, 2014). Linear behavior is typical to low porosity and highly-consolidated rock, whereas non-linear behavior is typical to high porosity and weakly-consolidated rock. This simulator shows that both these linear and non-linear behaviour of Cr change over affects the depletion of reservoir pressure after production. In most simulation cases, the effect of changing rock compressibility is often neglected, so the Cr is kept constant. This simulator also shows the difference ...
